# RI COVID-19 GRAPHS (ri-covid-graphs)

## Intro

This repo contains the source code that drives [this](http://computergeek1100.github.io/ri-covid-graphs) site. All graphs are created using an R script, which reads in data from the RIDOH public spreadsheet and automatically creates interactive graphs using [plotly](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/). These are output as HTML files, which are embedded into the site on github.io.
